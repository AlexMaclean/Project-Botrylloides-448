## Description

This repository contains the code and code generated artifacts for the Botrylloides Group investigation of the MaSurRCa hybrid assembler.

## File Structure

### [bacteria-experiments/](bacteria-experiments/)

This directory holds the setup and data of the various experiments we ran, it also holds the shared
config files.

- **[thread-count](bacteria-experiments/thread-count)**
  [:chart_with_upwards_trend: plots](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/Rplots.pdf)
  [:clipboard: raw data](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/data-11-8-2.csv)
  [:page_with_curl: script](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/run-experiment)

- **[jf-hash-size](bacteria-experiments/jf-hash-size)**
  [:chart_with_upwards_trend: plots](bacteria-experiments/jf-hash-size/Rplots.pdf)
  [:clipboard: raw data](bacteria-experiments/jf-hash-size/data-11-9.csv)
  [:page_with_curl: script](bacteria-experiments/jf-hash-size/run-experiment)

- **[thread-count](bacteria-experiments/thread-count)**
  [:chart_with_upwards_trend: plots](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/Rplots.pdf)
  [:clipboard: raw data](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/data-11-8-2.csv)
  [:page_with_curl: script](bacteria-experiments/thread-count/run-experiment)


### [scripts/](/scripts)

The scripts directory holds some shared helper scripts that many of the experiments use

- **[assemble-with-stats](/scripts/assemble-with-stats)** - Assumes it is run in a directory containing an assemble.sh file generated by a call to masurca. Runs that script and times it, then looks through the logs to generate time breakouts, also runs Quast and records some quality stats. Prints all results to the console in csv row format. If the "header" option is specified prints the csv header.
- **[cleanup-experiment](/scripts/cleanup-experiment)** - Run in a directory of an experiment, removes all the trial files, containing the masurca assemblies, and removes the nohup output.
- **[graphs.R](/scripts/graphs.R)** - R script file containing methods to plot graphs of data generated from a csv file from many assemble-with-stats runs. Contains a function to graph N50 plus Genome Size estimate, # contigs, and runtimes with breakouts.
